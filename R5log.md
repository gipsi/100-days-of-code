A moment to learn a little about Larry Tesler who died 
this week. RIP.

"Conceived, implemented and usability-tested 
GUI (graphical user interface) and 
IDE (integrated development environment) capabilities 
that have become standards in the industry, including the 
ability to:… insert or overwrite text without entering a 
mode by simply clicking or dragging and then typing… move 
or copy text without entering a mode using cut/copy and paste… 
type or paste find & replace text into a 
form that can be edited before and after searching…"


["copy and paste came from Gypsy"](https://youtu.be/Dhmz68CII9Y)

through tweets.

Amongst the branching hyperlinks

Semiotic termiology

#100DaysofCode day 10

A lot of copy and pasting hypertext tree 
like construction (coding) and an encounter 
with semiotic terminology for meaningful  
deconstruction (decoding).

Nearly lost the plot when a power cut made

Obsessive two days coding Hypermedia site.
A stormy night kept me awake until 6 the first
night but a more sensible 3 the next.
The idea took longer to follow through than I
thought but it was a good exercise in staying 
focused and finishing what I set out to do.
First day I coded all the files and folders on phone.
Second day put all the files in GitHub repo.

Codes: a combination of semiotic systems, a supersystem, that function as general maps of meaning, belief systems about oneself and others, which imply views and attitudes about how the world is and/or ought to be. Codes are where semiotics and social structure and values connect.

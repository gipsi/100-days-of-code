A moment to learn a little about Larry Tesler who died 
this week. RIP.

"Conceived, implemented and usability-tested 
GUI (graphical user interface) and 
IDE (integrated development environment) capabilities 
that have become standards in the industry, including the 
ability to:… insert or overwrite text without entering a 
mode by simply clicking or dragging and then typing… move 
or copy text without entering a mode using cut/copy and paste… 
type or paste find & replace text into a 
form that can be edited before and after searching…"


["copy and paste came from Gypsy"](https://youtu.be/Dhmz68CII9Y)

Checking out how others are doing on the coding journey
through tweets.

Amongst the branching hyperlinks

Semiotic termiology

#100DaysofCode day 10

A lot of copy and pasting hypertext tree 
like construction (coding) and an encounter 
with semiotic terminology for meaningful  
deconstruction (decoding).

Nearly lost the plot when a power cut made

Obsessive two days coding Hypermedia site.
A stormy night kept me awake until 6 the first
night but a more sensible 3 the next.
The idea took longer to follow through than I
thought but it was a good exercise in staying 
focused and finishing what I set out to do.
First day I coded all the files and folders on phone.
Second day put all the files in GitHub repo.

Codes: a combination of semiotic systems, a supersystem, that function as general maps of meaning, belief systems about oneself and others, which imply views and attitudes about how the world is and/or ought to be. Codes are where semiotics and social structure and values connect.

Reading lots about when to use buttons or anchor tags.

I styled links to look like buttons for my project.
This was not a good idea. 
This article about [links v buttons by Marcy Sutton](https://marcysutton.com/links-vs-buttons-in-modern-web-applications) in particular reminded me why I need to focus on the foundations.

So far this round, all coding has been done on Android phone.
Spck editor is very good, but today I couldn't copy and paste with it
so caved in and switched to desktop. I was going to try do the whole 
100 days of coding on the phone and though I was enjoying the challenge
the results don't scale up well when viewed on larger screen.

I also decided to use w3.org stylesheets after trying lots of ways of
styling links in CSS and getting stuck on choosing colours which look
very different with a hover, or focus etc.  LoVe Fears HAte, link, visited,
focus, hover, active.

Updated about half the files of my project.

## R5D20

Finished updating the files and feeling better about focusing on how content
is presented with HTML.  Not so much how the code looks or even the presentation
for that matter, functionality and where it leads.

Yesterday I cloned the repo off GitHub to work on locally.  When I finished today
I used Git Bash to add, commit, push the code back to the remote repository.  
Sounds easy!  It took ages to figure out because Git told me it was all done when
it wasn't changing anything.

StackOverflow had the best solution after trawling through GitHub docs and a quick visit 
to BitBucket Tutorial.

Hypermedia project latest: Not too happy with how the links don't work on my Android phone.
They worked alright on desktop, but it's impossible to tap the last list item link without
hitting footer link instead and some of them don't seem to work at all.  Perhaps navigation 
at the top would be better.

Tried basscss on welcome page after reading about functional css on HTML Goodies. Google lighthouse 
results were better.

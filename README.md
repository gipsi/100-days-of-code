# I've joined the [#100DaysOfCode](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/start-2017-with-the-100daysofcode-improved-and-updated-18ce604b237b) Challenge

### Day  7: 2017-01-09

**Today's Progress:** HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap in CodePen. More progress with Portfolio 
Changing colours and images, a bit of real text instead of "Kitty ipsum"

**Thoughts:** Reading [The War of Art by Steven Pressfield](http://www.stevenpressfield.com/the-war-of-art/) and practicing mindful stoicism.

### Day 6: 2017-01-08

**Today's Progress:** Some tinkering with Freecodecamp portfolio on CodePen. Html hyperlinks.  Put in some images, buttons - placeholders.  Changed CSS background colours. Found out what target="blank" means from w3school.

**Thoughts:** Coming back to do some work on this project makes it feel easier.  Changing some of the images and moving things around, all in the pen helps reinforce what I'm doing ... didn't manage to centre bottom button though.

Made by [Thoragio](https://github.com/thoragio/100-days-of-code/blob/master/README.md)
helped a lot - thank you!

**Thoughts:** Looking at 100 Days of code repo [suggested resources](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code/blob/master/resources.md)
I'd also recommend:
* ["The Meditations" by Marcus Aurelius](https://librivox.org/the-meditations-of-marcus-aurelius/)  
I'm currently listening to the audiobook on Librivox.

* [The Stoic: 9 Principles to Help You Keep Calm in Chaos]
(http://99u.com/articles/24401/a-makers-guidebook-9-stoic-principles-to-nurture-your-life-and-work)

Is an outline of the principles of Stoicism which he practiced.

> "The goal of Stoicism is to attain inner peace by overcoming adversity"

### Day 3: 2017-01-05
**Today's Progress:** Trying to figure out if I can switch off Jekyll Theme and
use only html/css and also thinking about reversing this (bullet list) and write
at the top, and put in chapters (blog style).

**Thoughts:** Used the Jekyll [Minimal Theme by orderedlist](https://github.com/orderedlist/minimal)

### Day 2: 2017-01-04

**Today's Progress:** An Enki workout - Javascript Core

**Thoughts:** About habits, routines and and commitments.

**Link to work:**  Signed up to a reminder list from Enki [“Make Open Source
your 2017 Resolution”@MathieuDutour](https://blog.enki.com/make-open-source-your-2017-resolution-ec1a4569d43)



### Day 1: 2017-01-03

**Today's Progress:** Learning [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)

**Thoughts:** This is my third start of [#100DaysOfCode](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/start-2017-with-the-100daysofcode-improved-and-updated-18ce604b237b)   
I did the first 100 and carried on to do another 50 Days.  During that time I did FreeCodeCamp, SoloLearn
Enki ... And although I managed to code at  least an hour each day I did not
get around to keeping this log on Github. So having spent time regularly visiting
Through December then halfway through finding [#Commitmas-3 Return of Commitmas](https://github.com/gipsi/commitmas-3-return-of-commitmas/blob/master/README.md)
with a great selection of videos and podcasts to help stay on track, here goes!

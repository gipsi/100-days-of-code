### Day 10 : 2017-01-12

**Today's Progress:** Another lesson from Jeremy Keith's Resilient Web Design Chapter 6 Steps

" Here’s a threestep approach I take to web design:

Identify core functionality.Make that functionality available using the simplest possible (Web) technology.Enhance!"

**Thoughts:** Start with text

**Today's Progress:**  html and css on my webpage project.  Looked up how to make some text into a link then did it three times.

**Thoughts:** Keep simplifying which leads to thinking about the meaning of words quite a bit.
The difference between program, script and code.

Changed definition of what I'm  learning from  code
to software. Read loads about this. Software development, Software engineering, agile, programming, coding, computer science etc.

### Day 8:  2017-01-10
**Today's Progress:**  Important breakthrough reading [Jeremy Kieth's Resilient Web Design](https://resilientwebdesign.com)


At the end of Chapter 3: Visions there is a quote from Mark Boulton echoing John Allsop's A Dao of Web Design:

>   "Start designing from the content out, rather 
> than the canvas in."  

Jeremy 's reiteration of this point made me consider it some more:

>  "This contentout way of thinking is fundamentally different to the canvasin approach that dates all the way back to the Book of Kells."





**Thoughts:** Mulling over my portfolio page, thinking about its general appearance, background colour, images etc.  Choices, decisions about building it 'from the ground up'  as is recommended in the FreeCodeacamp Challenge, with HTML and CSS or using a Bootstrap Template ... I have been using a W3schools Simply Me Template and modifying that to date ...

so ... I made the icons a bit more inkified and graphic with paint.net, and rather liking the neutrality took off all the colour.

The pendulum swing lyric in this Linkin Park video came to mind as I was grappling with a different way of seeing content.

Modifying code on codepen through android on different browsers and WindowsPC , copy and pasting snippets, working out what's broken.Trying to keep some semblance of order with this simple piece of HTML is all the while keeping  responsiveness in my thoughts.

### Day  7: 2017-01-09

**Today's Progress:** HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap in CodePen. More progress with Portfolio 
Changing colours and images, a bit of real text instead of "Kitty ipsum"

**Thoughts:** Reading [The War of Art by Steven Pressfield](http://www.stevenpressfield.com/the-war-of-art/) and practicing mindful stoicism.

### Day 6: 2017-01-08

**Today's Progress:** Some tinkering with Freecodecamp portfolio on CodePen. Html hyperlinks.  Put in some images, buttons - placeholders.  Changed CSS background colours. Found out what target="blank" means from w3school.

**Thoughts:** Coming back to do some work on this project makes it feel easier.  Changing some of the images and moving things around, all in the pen helps reinforce what I'm doing ... didn't manage to centre bottom button though.

Made by [Thoragio](https://github.com/thoragio/100-days-of-code/blob/master/README.md)
helped a lot - thank you!

**Thoughts:** Looking at 100 Days of code repo [suggested resources](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code/blob/master/resources.md)
I'd also recommend:
* ["The Meditations" by Marcus Aurelius](https://librivox.org/the-meditations-of-marcus-aurelius/)  
I'm currently listening to the audiobook on Librivox.

* [The Stoic: 9 Principles to Help You Keep Calm in Chaos]
(http://99u.com/articles/24401/a-makers-guidebook-9-stoic-principles-to-nurture-your-life-and-work)

Is an outline of the principles of Stoicism which he practiced.

> "The goal of Stoicism is to attain inner peace by overcoming adversity"

### Day 4: 2017-01-06

**Today's Progress:** Tidied up GitHub blog page.

**Thoughts:** All on Android phone, battery too low to explain.

### Day 3: 2017-01-05
**Today's Progress:** Trying to figure out if I can switch off Jekyll Theme and
use only html/css and also thinking about reversing this (bullet list) and write
at the top, and put in chapters (blog style).

**Thoughts:** Used the Jekyll [Minimal Theme by orderedlist](https://github.com/orderedlist/minimal)

### Day 2: 2017-01-04

**Today's Progress:** An Enki workout - Javascript Core

**Thoughts:** About habits, routines and and commitments.

**Link to work:**  Signed up to a reminder list from Enki [“Make Open Source
your 2017 Resolution”@MathieuDutour](https://blog.enki.com/make-open-source-your-2017-resolution-ec1a4569d43)



### Day 1: 2017-01-03

**Today's Progress:** Learning [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)

**Thoughts:** This is my third start of [#100DaysOfCode](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/start-2017-with-the-100daysofcode-improved-and-updated-18ce604b237b)   
I did the first 100 and carried on to do another 50 Days.  During that time I did FreeCodeCamp, SoloLearn
Enki ... And although I managed to code at  least an hour each day I did not
get around to keeping this log on Github. So having spent time regularly visiting
Through December then halfway through finding [#Commitmas-3 Return of Commitmas](https://github.com/gipsi/commitmas-3-return-of-commitmas/blob/master/README.md)
with a great selection of videos and podcasts to help stay on track, here goes!

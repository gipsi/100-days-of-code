**Today's Progress: Getting a overall idea in my mind of a consistent style for this weeks tasks. Made a notepad and changed Mondays clock to match.

*Thoughts: Trying to do the simplest code I can. I started this task with a picture of a notebook, then dropped that idea. Found a code snipped on js fiddle. Nice and easy. The html just tag with some text. And Im finding I learn more by tweaking the css, experimenting.</p> <p><strong>Link to work:</strong> <a href="https://codepen.io/gipsi/full/NdvOoG/">A notepad</a></p> <h3>Day 22 2017-01-24</h3> <p><strong>Today's Progress:</strong> Todays #dailycssimage was a ruler</p> <p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> Some helpful tools I found doing Google searches</p> <blockquote> <p>*<a href="https://css3gen.com/text-shadow/">text shadow generator</a> *<a href="http://www.cssmatic.com/box-shadow">box-shadow generator</a> *<a href="http://colorhunt.co/">color hunt</a></p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Link to work:</strong> <a href="http://codepen.io/gipsi/">http://codepen.io/gipsi/</a></p> <p>### Day 21: "017-01-23 </p> <p><strong>Today's Progress:</strong> Made a clock.</p> <p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> It was fun.</p> <p><strong>Link to work:</strong> <a href="http://s.codepen.io/gipsi/debug/ygXexN/NjrYzyoZvKQA">http://s.codepen.io/gipsi/debug/ygXexN/NjrYzyoZvKQA</a></p> <h3>Day 20 2017-01-22</h3> <p><strong>Today's Progress:</strong> yak shaving</p> <p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> bike sheds</p> <p><strong>Link to work:</strong> <a href="https://codepen.io/gipsi/full/MJjxww/">https://codepen.io/gipsi/full/MJjxww/</a></p> <h3>Day 19: 2017-01-21</h3> <p><strong>Today's Progress:</strong> Fiver - Another pure css image.

**Today's Progress:** 4/50 css images tiger

**Thoughts:** absorbing, have to concentrate, enjoying the process

**Link to work:** https://codepen.io/gipsi/pen/WRpaVM


 
### Day 17: 2017-01-19

**Today's Progress:** Good progress with 3rd css image-beaver. It is different using pc tools
 not entirely better.  Indeed some things like taking screenshot and uploading to cloud feels easier on phone.
 
 **Thoughts:** Doing something every day certainly helps the learning process.  css images 50 is a great project and the tutorial on medium explains things  really well ... and its fun!

 **Link to work:** https://codepen.io/gipsi/details/XppmNm


### Day 16: 2017-01-18

**Today's Progress:** coded elephant picture, 2nd task for css daily challenge.  Slighly better than 1st image but still on a steep learning curve.  Getting the hang of doing it all on phone.

**Thoughts:** Enjoying the challenge.  Much room for improvement.  Its good having a template and modifying it ... it works better when I do that on the phone then copy pasting into codepen rather than attempting it in the pen.  The most annoying thing in codepen is when I delete a couple of letters, wont stop and deletes a great chunk.

### Day 15: 2017-01-17

**Today's Progress:** First css image for #cssdailyimages.  All done on Android phone.

then used the HTML and CSS template of a koala bear.  Modified it a bit in codepen and took a screenshot.  Got a URL and put it in Portfolio thumbnail. Tweeted. 

**Thoughts:**  Plenty of room for improvement. Learning curve.  I like the way things can be changed later.

### Day  14: 2017-01-16

 **Today's Progress:** Started  enthusiastically on css project, offline on phone using Code Book App.  Couldnt figure out how to set backround image.  Something to do with the href=url("style.css") part.  Kept trying different directory paths but no joy.

 **Thoughts:** Email from css images challenge cheered me up and I forked and modified the Portfolio Template.  Experimented with different colours for a bit to see how that works.  I think Codepen is great for reading and playing around with code.

 **Today's Progress:** Good progress with code editor on phone.  Made my 'core functionality html page' saved it and added a css colored background.

 **Thoughts:** Interesting trying to code on phone and quite pleased with how much I can do offline.

Online didnt go so well  and changing the background color of my portfolio page in codepen didn't work .

 **Link to work:**  Reading about [UX Honeycombe on Peter Morville's blog](http://intertwingled.org/user-experience-honeycomb/)
 
 

### Day 11: 2017-01-13

**Today's Progress:** Testing different code editors on phone settled on AWD as it's the first one I successfully previewed the result.

**Today's Progress:**  html and css on my webpage project.  Looked up how to make some text into a link then did it three times.

**Thoughts:** Keep simplifying which leads to thinking about the meaning of words quite a bit.
The difference between program, script and code.

Changed definition of what I'm  learning from  code
to software. Read loads about this. Software development, Software engineering, agile, programming, coding, computer science etc.

### Day 8:  2017-01-10
**Today's Progress:**  Important breakthrough reading [Jeremy Kieth's Resilient Web Design](https://resilientwebdesign.com)


At the end of Chapter 3: Visions there is a quote from Mark Boulton echoing John Allsop's A Dao of Web Design:

>   "Start designing from the content out, rather 
> than the canvas in."  

Jeremy 's reiteration of this point made me consider it some more:

>  "This contentout way of thinking is fundamentally different to the canvasin approach that dates all the way back to the Book of Kells."





**Thoughts:** Mulling over my portfolio page, thinking about its general appearance, background colour, images etc.  Choices, decisions about building it 'from the ground up'  as is recommended in the FreeCodeacamp Challenge, with HTML and CSS or using a Bootstrap Template ... I have been using a W3schools Simply Me Template and modifying that to date ...

so ... I made the icons a bit more inkified and graphic with paint.net, and rather liking the neutrality took off all the colour.

The pendulum swing lyric in this Linkin Park video came to mind as I was grappling with a different way of seeing content.

Modifying code on codepen through android on different browsers and WindowsPC , copy and pasting snippets, working out what's broken.Trying to keep some semblance of order with this simple piece of HTML is all the while keeping  responsiveness in my thoughts.

### Day  7: 2017-01-09

**Today's Progress:** HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap in CodePen. More progress with Portfolio 
Changing colours and images, a bit of real text instead of "Kitty ipsum"

**Thoughts:** Reading [The War of Art by Steven Pressfield](http://www.stevenpressfield.com/the-war-of-art/) and practicing mindful stoicism.


**Link to work:** [Freecodecamp Portfolio on CodePen](http://codepen.io/gipsi/full/VmzPJg/)

### Day 6: 2017-01-08

**Today's Progress:** Some tinkering with Freecodecamp portfolio on CodePen. Html hyperlinks.  Put in some images, buttons - placeholders.  Changed CSS background colours. Found out what target="blank" means from w3school.

**Thoughts:** Coming back to do some work on this project makes it feel easier.  Changing some of the images and moving things around, all in the pen helps reinforce what I'm doing ... didn't manage to centre bottom button though.

Made by [Thoragio](https://github.com/thoragio/100-days-of-code/blob/master/README.md)
helped a lot - thank you!

**Thoughts:** Looking at 100 Days of code repo [suggested resources](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code/blob/master/resources.md)
I'd also recommend:
* ["The Meditations" by Marcus Aurelius](https://librivox.org/the-meditations-of-marcus-aurelius/)  
I'm currently listening to the audiobook on Librivox.

* [The Stoic: 9 Principles to Help You Keep Calm in Chaos]
(http://99u.com/articles/24401/a-makers-guidebook-9-stoic-principles-to-nurture-your-life-and-work)

### Day 3: 2017-01-05
**Today's Progress:** Trying to figure out if I can switch off Jekyll Theme and
use only html/css and also thinking about reversing this (bullet list) and write
at the top, and put in chapters (blog style).

**Thoughts:** Used the Jekyll [Minimal Theme by orderedlist](https://github.com/orderedlist/minimal)

### Day 1: 2017-01-03

**Today's Progress:** Learning [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)

**Thoughts:** This is my third start of [#100DaysOfCode](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/start-2017-with-the-100daysofcode-improved-and-updated-18ce604b237b)   
I did the first 100 and carried on to do another 50 Days.  During that time I did FreeCodeCamp, SoloLearn
Enki ... And although I managed to code at  least an hour each day I did not
get around to keeping this log on Github. So having spent time regularly visiting
Through December then halfway through finding [#Commitmas-3 Return of Commitmas](https://github.com/gipsi/commitmas-3-return-of-commitmas/blob/master/README.md)
with a great selection of videos and podcasts to help stay on track, here goes!
